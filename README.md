## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`)
- K-Means clustering with **Elbow Method** for optimal `k`

---

Key steps:
- Load and explore dataset (Age, Gender, Annual Income, Spending Score)
- Determine optimal clusters with **Elbow Method**
- Perform **K-Means clustering** and visualize results in 2D/3D
- Profile each cluster to understand customer types

---

## ✅ Insights
- **Cluster 1:** High Income, Low Spending → Affluent but conservative buyers  
- **Cluster 2:** Mid Income, High Spending → Loyal high-value customers
